# pincell.h5m and pincell-implicit.exo

These two files contain identical meshing in MOAB (`.h5m`) and libMesh (`.exo`)
formats. Metadata is applied in the Cubit model (found in `pincell-both.cub5`)
for both formats as well.

In the case of the libMesh model, boundary conditions are only applied to the
outer volume. The interior interfaces of the model are discovered automatically
as implicit boundaries based on the transition between mesh blocks.
